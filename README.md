# Blog App with MongoDB, Express.js, and EJS

This is a simple blog application built using MongoDB, Express.js, and EJS templates.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations:** Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- **MongoDB Database:** Data is stored in a MongoDB database, providing a scalable and flexible data storage solution.
- **Express.js Backend:** Built with Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **EJS Templates:** Frontend views are rendered using EJS (Embedded JavaScript), allowing for dynamic HTML content generation.
- **JWT and Cookies:** I used JWT for authentication and authorization. Also, I've stored them into cookies.
